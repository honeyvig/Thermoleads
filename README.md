=============
To build a Python application that addresses the issues outlined for ThermoLeads, we will focus on creating an AI-powered solution that generates qualified leads for smart thermostat installers, integrates the leads with a custom CRM system, and provides features for easy management and follow-up.
Overview of the Solution

    Lead Generation (AI-Powered): Use machine learning to analyze data and identify qualified leads for smart thermostat installations.
    CRM Integration: Store leads in a custom CRM system, enabling easy management and follow-up.
    Seamless Delivery of Leads: Provide an interface for installers to receive and manage leads efficiently.

Steps to Build the Application
1. AI-Powered Lead Generation

We'll use a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models to analyze customer behavior, reviews, social media, etc., to identify individuals or businesses that are likely to be interested in smart thermostat installations.

We'll simulate the AI-based lead qualification with a basic predictive model.
Install Required Libraries

pip install pandas scikit-learn requests Flask

Lead Generation Logic (Python Example)

Here’s how we can begin with the basic AI model for lead qualification:

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Simulate a dataset
data = {
    'home_size': [1500, 2500, 2000, 1800, 3000],  # Home size (sqft)
    'income_level': [3, 4, 3, 2, 5],  # Income level (on a scale of 1 to 5)
    'interest_in_technology': [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],  # Whether they're interested in smart tech (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
    'lead_quality': [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]  # 1 = Qualified, 0 = Unqualified
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Feature columns and target
X = df.drop('lead_quality', axis=1)
y = df['lead_quality']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

This is a basic model that uses features like home_size, income_level, and interest_in_technology to predict whether a lead is qualified (1) or not (0).

In a real-world scenario, you would replace this simple dataset with more complex, real-world data and enhance it using techniques like web scraping, NLP, or social media analysis to identify high-quality leads based on their behavior.
2. CRM System for Managing Leads

The CRM will be built as a Flask web app that provides a dashboard to manage leads, track interactions, and set reminders for follow-up actions.
Create a Flask CRM Web App

pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy

Basic Flask App for CRM

from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, url_for
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///crm.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# CRM model
class Lead(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    phone = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
    lead_quality = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)  # 1 = Qualified, 0 = Unqualified

# Routes
@app.route('/')
def home():
    leads = Lead.query.all()
    return render_template('index.html', leads=leads)

@app.route('/add', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def add_lead():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.form['name']
        email = request.form['email']
        phone = request.form['phone']
        lead_quality = request.form['lead_quality']

        new_lead = Lead(name=name, email=email, phone=phone, lead_quality=lead_quality)
        db.session.add(new_lead)
        db.session.commit()

        return redirect(url_for('home'))
    return render_template('add_lead.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()
    app.run(debug=True)
